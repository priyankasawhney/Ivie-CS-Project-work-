The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals including pets in some situations, mostly during close contact.
To protect your pet from the COVID-19 virus, don't let your dog or cat interact with people or animals outside your household. For example: 

<p> </p>
        <li>Avoid dog parks or public places where many people and dogs gather.</li>
         <li> When walking your dog, make sure your dog wears a leash and keep your dog at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people and animals.</li>
        <li> Keep cats indoors as much as possible.</li>
        <li>If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets and other animals. </li>
        <ll> Pet owners and every eligible person in the household should get vaccinated.</li>
        <li>Pet owners should not allow pets to have contact with unvaccinated people outside the household, if possible. </li>
       </ol>
