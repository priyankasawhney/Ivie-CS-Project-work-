<li> Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet's treatment and care.</li>
<li> Depending on your petâ€™s symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend that your pet be isolated at home, instead 
<br> of staying in the hospital.</br></li>

 <li> The protection mask does not belong on your pet . It can lead to choking hazards. </li>
